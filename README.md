## Microfrontend Workshop

This project shows how to build microfronend using [React](https://react.dev/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

#### Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version `v18.16.0`

**Note:** I recommed to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage NodeJS versions

cd ${mfe-directory}
npm install

where:
- `${mfe-directory} ` is every micro frontend host and it could be these values:
